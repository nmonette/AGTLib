# Learning in Competitive Games
These are algorithms for solving two-player competitive games. 
Note that these algorithms will converge to a Nash Equilibrium 
for zero-sum games, and a Coarse-Correlated Equilibrium for 
general-sum games. Please visit `Theory.equilibrium` for more
information on equilibriums.
